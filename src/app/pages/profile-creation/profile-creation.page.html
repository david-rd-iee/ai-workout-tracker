            In order to use Atlas, you must have at least one valid payment method stored on file, and the storage of such payment method is subject to our Stored Payment Terms and Conditions. Atlas does not and cannot control any Consumer or other individual’s interest in contacting or hiring you. You explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts or Fees due will be made by electronic mail or by phone. You agree that all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. You agree that you have the ability to store such electronic communications such that they remain accessible to you in an unchanged form. You agree to keep your contact information current, including but not limited to your email address and phone number. Such communication may be made by Atlas or by anyone on our behalf, including but not limited to a third-party collection agent. Users are responsible for determining and paying any taxes applicable to transactions conducted through the Atlas platform, including but not limited to sales tax, use tax, or income tax. Atlas utilizes third-party payment processors to handle transactions. By using Atlas, you agree to the terms and conditions of such processors. Atlas is not responsible for errors or delays caused by third-party payment systems. If payment is not received or a payment method is declined, Atlas reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account until payment is resolved. Late payments may be subject to additional fees, including collection costs. All fees paid to Atlas are non-refundable unless otherwise explicitly stated. Any disputes regarding fees must be submitted to Atlas in writing within 30 days of the charge. While Atlas takes reasonable measures to secure stored payment information, you acknowledge that no system is completely secure. Atlas is not liable for unauthorized access or use of your payment method unless caused by our gross negligence. All fees are charged in USD, and users are responsible for any currency conversion fees applied by their financial institution. Failure to pay any fees owed to Atlas may result in suspension or termination of your account, including loss of access to the Platform and associated services. You agree to indemnify and hold Atlas harmless from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from your failure to pay applicable taxes or fees.
            MARKETPLACE PAYMENTS
            The Atlas platform may facilitate payments between Consumers and Atlas Professionals (“Marketplace Payments”) through our payment processing partner Stripe, but Atlas is not a party to any such Marketplace Payments or any Pro Services related thereto. Unless otherwise indicated, Marketplace Payments may be made for services only; Marketplace Payments for tangible personal property is prohibited. By agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as a Atlas Professional on the Platform, you hereby appoint Atlas to act as your agent for the limited purpose of facilitating and receiving Marketplace Payments on your behalf through Stripe as contemplated herein. You acknowledge and agree that, subject to any rights you have pertaining to Marketplace Payment disputes, once a Marketplace Payment has been made through the Atlas Platform, the payment obligation of the payor User shall be deemed satisfied by the payee User upon receipt of the Marketplace Payment by Atlas as though the payor User had made the Marketplace Payment directly to the payee User.
            Atlas does not offer any professional services directly or indirectly unless specified in a separate contract to which Atlas is a direct party. Any time a Consumer pays for or books Pro Services on the Platform or receives a quote in connection with Pro Services, such Consumer is contracting directly with the Atlas Professional offering such Pro Service. Notwithstanding any facilitation of booking or payment, you understand and agree that Atlas (i) does not sell, offer, provide or subcontract any Pro Service and (ii) is not liable in any way for any Pro Service, except to the extent expressly set forth in the Atlas Guarantee (which guarantee is provided in connection with Atlas’s role as a marketplace only, not in a role of provider of Pro Services). Notwithstanding Atlas’s role as a payment facilitator, each Atlas Professional who receives Marketplace Payments understands and agrees that they are obligated to perform the Pro Service as outlined in their agreement with the Consumer and work to remedy any material deviations from such contract.
            Atlas Professionals who receive Marketplace Payments from Consumers on Atlas must agree to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Services Agreement. Atlas Professionals should never agree to receive a Marketplace Payment, or perform services in expectation thereof, before they have confirmed that they can comply with such Stripe agreements and, in particular, Atlas Professionals should note that they will need a social security number or employer identification number in order to receive Marketplace Payments. As an Atlas Professional, by agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as an Atlas Professional on Atlas, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Connected Account Agreement and Stripe Services Agreement, as those agreements may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of receiving payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Atlas with accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Atlas to share this information and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe. Atlas Professionals also agree that Atlas may debit their Stripe account in connection with disputes with Consumers. Atlas reserves the right to process such debits and to withhold final payments until Atlas has investigated disputes. Atlas may make a final decision on disputes in their sole discretion and, as a Atlas Professional, you understand that all Marketplace Payments you may earn on the Platform are subject to such decisions. Additionally, Atlas Professionals agree that Atlas  may reverse payments that have been made to a Atlas  Professional’s Stripe Connected Account when a customer refund or guarantee payout is warranted, including in connection with such Atlas Professional’s actions or inactions that are prohibited by these Terms.
            As a Consumer making a Marketplace Payment through Stripe, you agree to pay all amounts you owe when due using your preferred payment method. You further authorize Stripe to charge your preferred payment method for amounts you owe when they are due, whether they are recurring or one-time payments. You must keep all payment information you provide us up-to-date, accurate and complete. When you store a payment method with us, you agree to our Stored Payment Terms and Conditions. Do not share your payment card, bank account or other financial information with any other User. We take steps to secure all payment methods and other personal financial information, but we expressly disclaim any liability to you, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages you may suffer as a result of the disclosure of your personal financial information to any unintended recipients.
            Atlas may enable you to make Marketplace Payments using credit, debit, or prepaid cards, by linking your bank account, or by any other payment method we support. We reserve the right to cancel your ability to make payments with one or more of the payment methods you have authorized in our sole and absolute discretion.
            If you choose your bank account as your Marketplace Payment method, you authorize Stripe to make Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) withdrawals from your bank account, and to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate any dispute involving payments you make to us or to a User, which may include ordering a credit report and performing other credit checks or verifying the information you provide us against third-party databases. You authorize Atlas or our provider to initiate one or more ACH debit entries (withdrawals) or the creation of an equivalent bank draft for the specified amount(s) from your bank account, and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such payments. You also authorize the bank that holds your bank account to deduct any such payments in the amounts and frequency designated in your Account. Your authorization will remain in effect until canceled in writing by you. You agree to notify us of any changes to your account information or termination of your authorization at least five days prior to your next payment.
            If your full payment is not processed by us at the same time, you hereby authorize partial debits from your bank account, not to exceed the total amount of your order. You agree to pay any ACH fees or fines you or we incur associated with transactions you authorize. This return fee will vary based on which state you are located in. The return fee may be added to your payment amount and debited from your bank account if we resubmit an ACH debit due to insufficient funds. We may initiate a collection process or legal action to collect any money owed to us. You agree to pay all our costs for such action, including any reasonable attorneys' fees. Federal law limits your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous, or unauthorized transactions from your bank account based on how quickly you report it to your financial institution. You must report any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions to your bank no more than 60 days after the disputed transaction appeared on your bank account statement. Please contact your bank for more information about the policies and procedures that apply unauthorized transactions and the limits on your liability.
            Marketplace Payment Disputes: All requests for Marketplace Payment chargebacks, errors, claims, refunds and disputes (“Payment Disputes”) will be subject to review by Atlas in accordance with the rules applicable to the payment method you used to make the Marketplace Payment and will be in Atlas’s absolute discretion. Atlas is not liable to you under any circumstances for Payment Disputes we are unable to resolve in your favor. We will normally process a valid written Payment Dispute request within 30 days after we receive it, unless a shorter period is required by law. You may file a Payment Dispute by emailing it to Atlas support. If you close or deactivate your Account before we adjudicate your Payment Dispute, we will not be able to issue you any amounts you are owed. We will attempt to pay you any Payment Disputed amounts you are owed using the method with which you made the disputed payment, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so if your payment method information is inaccurate, incomplete, or has been canceled.
            If your actions result in, or are likely to result in, a Payment Dispute, a violation of these Terms of Use or the creation of other risks to Atlas or our payment processing partners, or if we determine that your Account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, then we may permanently withhold any amounts owed to you in our sole discretion. If you have a past due balance due on any Account, or for any additional amounts that we determine you owe us, we may, without limiting any other rights or remedies: (a) charge one or more of your payment methods; (b) offset any amounts you owe us against amounts you may be owed; (c) invoice you for amounts due to us, which such amounts will be due upon receipt; (d) reverse or block any credits to your bank account; or (e) collect payment from you by any other lawful means.
            If you fail to make Marketplace Payments you owe when due, or if Atlas is unable to charge one of your payment methods for any reason, Atlas reserves all rights permissible under law to recover payment and all costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys' fees and related costs, in our pursuit of payment. You explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts or overdue payments will be made by electronic mail or by phone. Such communication may be made by Atlas or by anyone on our behalf, including but not limited to a third-party collections agent. Atlas may, from time to time, place a hold on any of your payment methods in order to prevent failed payments or in order to reverse your booking. Clients can contact Atlas Support to cancel their recurring monthly subscription, or reach out to their trainer directly through the in-app messaging feature.
            Non-Solicitation
            By using the Atlas platform, Trainers agree that they will not solicit, offer, or accept services from any clients introduced through the platform outside of Atlas. This includes, but is not limited to, providing personal training services, consulting, or any related services to clients once a relationship has been established through the platform. Trainers may not contact clients directly to propose services outside of the platform or offer fitness training, nutrition planning, or wellness coaching without the involvement of Atlas. If a trainer and client wish to continue their professional relationship after the initial engagement through Atlas, such services must be arranged through the platform unless otherwise agreed upon with Atlas in writing. Any attempt to engage in off-platform agreements with clients introduced via Atlas will be considered a violation of these Terms and may result in immediate suspension or termination of the trainer's account.

            STORED PAYMENTS AND FEES
            By providing your payment method information to Atlas, you consent to Atlas storing your payment method information (“Stored Payment Method”). Atlas’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (together, the “Atlas Agreements”) apply fully and completely to these Terms and Conditions. Your Stored Payment Method will only be used, stored, and disclosed in accordance with the Atlas Agreements or as otherwise agreed to by you. Terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Atlas Agreements.This agreement between you and Atlas is valid indefinitely unless you request deletion of your Stored Payment Method. Because all Atlas Professionals are required to maintain a Stored Payment Method on their accounts in order to process multiple pro services in a single transaction. You may request deletion of your Stored Payment by contacting Atlas

            ATLAS PROMOTIONS
            You may receive certain offers from Atlas (“Promotions”), including but not limited to discounted or free use of the Platform for a limited period, discounts on or credits towards payments made for Pro Services, and discounts or credits in relation to referrals. Any Promotions are offered at Atlas’s discretion, and may be revoked at any time and for any reason. Note that any attempt (as determined by Atlas in its sole discretion) to game, fraud, or in any way circumvent terms of a promotion is grounds for revocation, including but not limited to providing false information or utilizing multiple User accounts.
            You are only eligible for any benefits described in the Promotion if (a) you received a communication directly from Atlas offering you that Promotion, (b) you satisfy all the requirements identified in that communication; and (c) you maintain an account in good standing with Atlas. We may condition receipt of a benefit described in a Promotion in any manner we see appropriate, including limiting eligibility to a subset of Users, to specific categories, or to certain dates. To be eligible for a benefit described in a Promotion, you may need to take a specific action (including but not limited to signing up for a service) or make a payment for specific services. Except where otherwise noted, Promotions are for one-time use only and cannot be stacked (i.e. a User may only use one Promotion per project).
            Any benefits from participating in the Promotion, requirements of accepting the offer, and any other conditions to receive any benefit described in the Promotion will be disclosed to you. After a Promotion ends, regardless of whether you have already satisfied the requirements, you will be ineligible to receive those benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Atlas may revoke a benefit if we believe that you have not satisfied the Promotion requirements, including maintaining an Account in good standing.

Upon timely notification, Atlas will provide either (a) a replacement session with a different Atlas Professional at no additional charge, or (b) a refund of the fair-market value of the first session, at the Participant’s election. This First Session Guarantee applies only to the Participant’s first completed live session, is non-transferable, and may not be combined with any other promotions, credits, or guarantees offered by Atlas. Atlas reserves the right to request verification of attendance and participation in the initial session prior to issuing a remedy under this provision. The remedies described herein constitute the Participant’s sole and exclusive relief under the First Session Guarantee.
            ATLAS 8 WEEK GUARANTEE PROGRAM 


            The Atlas Guarantee Program (the “Program”) is a remedy offered by Atlas to eligible clients (“Participants”) engaged in in-person training whose diligent adherence to an approved plan fails to produce objectively measurable results. Participants must notify their assigned Atlas Professional of their intent to enroll in the Program no later than their first live training session. Failure to notify the Atlas Professional by that time renders the Participant ineligible for the Program. At enrollment, the Participant and Atlas Professional must complete baseline assessments: (i) a body-weight measurement recorded on an NTEP-certified scale within the Atlas Platform, and (ii) logged documentation on the Atlas Platform of initial strength or performance benchmarks (e.g., resistance, repetitions, distances, durations, or intensity), which serve as the reference points for evaluating progress.
            The Program’s initial period is eight weeks (the “Initial Term”). During the Initial Term, the Participant must attend at least two in-person training sessions per week and comply with not less than ninety percent (90%) of all prescribed directives. Compliance is documented through workout logs, Atlas Professional notes, and exercise acknowledgments within the Atlas Platform (“Adherence Records”). “Measurable progress” is defined as either (a) a net change in body weight of at least one (1) pound from the baseline measurement, or (b) an improvement of at least one (1) whole unit in a strength or performance benchmark compared to the baseline measurement—for example, lifting one (1) additional pound, completing one (1) additional repetition, running one (1) second faster, or covering one (1) additional foot in distance, all as compared to the baseline measurements recorded at enrollment. If any of the above criteria is achieved, the Program obligations are considered met and the guarantee remedy will not apply.
            If a Participant is injured during the Initial Term, the Program is suspended and may resume once written medical clearance for unrestricted activity is provided. The Participant must then restart the full eight-week Initial Term with all requirements applying anew. The restart must occur with the same Atlas Professional; if that Atlas Professional is unavailable, Atlas will assign another. In such case, session costs remain the same or may be adjusted to the new Atlas Professional’s rates. If no mutually agreeable Atlas Professional or rate is available, the Participant may decline and exit the Program without penalty. Only one suspension and restart is permitted, except that Atlas may, at its discretion, allow additional restarts under extraordinary circumstances.
            If the Participant becomes sick, travels, or is otherwise unable to maintain ninety percent (90%) adherence, the Program must be restarted from the beginning. Any missed sessions must be made up within fourteen (14) calendar days of the original date. If the Participant loses strength or gains weight during that time, such results serve as the revised baseline from which measurable change must occur. Where both restart and termination conditions could apply, restart will control if the Participant has documented circumstances such as illness or travel; otherwise, termination will apply.
            Within seven (7) calendar days after the Initial Term, Atlas will review Adherence Records. If the Participant has met all eligibility requirements but has not achieved measurable progress, Atlas will (i) reassign the Participant to a new Atlas Professional and (ii) provide a new customized program (the “Guarantee Phase”). The Guarantee Phase requires Atlas Professional check-ins at a frequency determined by the new Atlas Professional, either one (1) or two (2) times per month, in-person or online. At the end of the first month, the Atlas Professional may review whether to maintain this schedule or adjust to check-ins every two (2) months. Following the every-two-month period, the Atlas Professional may, at their discretion, transition the Participant to yearly check-ins. Participants are responsible for contacting Atlas to schedule within that year. “Yearly” means within twelve (12) months from the date the Participant is transitioned to annual check-ins. Atlas will provide reasonable availability, but failure to schedule within the designated year results in termination of Program benefits. For any Guarantee Phase check-in or assessment, the Participant must provide at least twenty-four (24) hours’ notice to cancel and must reschedule the appointment to occur within fifteen (15) calendar days of the original date, subject to reasonable availability. This accommodation may not be used more than once during the Guarantee Phase, absent documented extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, emergency, or travel) acceptable to Atlas in its reasonable discretion. A cancellation with fewer than twenty-four (24) hours’ notice, a failure to reschedule within fifteen (15) calendar days, or a second cancellation without qualifying extenuating circumstances will be treated as a missed check-in/assessment for purposes of Program termination under clause (b) below. If an Atlas Professional cancels, the session will be rescheduled within fifteen (15) calendar days without penalty to the Participant.
            Adherence may be reviewed every two (2) weeks at the discretion of the Atlas Professional, and Atlas reserves the right to require such reviews. Any decision not to conduct a review does not waive Atlas’s right to enforce adherence or to conduct later reviews. Adherence must remain at or above ninety percent (90%). Adherence is verified primarily through exercise and nutrition logging within the Atlas Platform. If the Atlas Professional modifies the plan to include measurable changes in pounds, repetitions, distance, volume, or intensity, such numerical changes will be visible within the Participant’s program. The Participant’s acknowledgment of completing such changes—whether by logging in the Platform, verbal confirmation, email, message, or other documented communication—shall, for Program purposes only, be deemed sufficient proof of measurable change. Verbal confirmations must be memorialized in the Platform notes by the Atlas Professional to be effective.
            The Program will terminate if the Participant (a) fails to maintain ninety percent (90%) adherence, (b) misses two required check-ins or assessments, or (c) fails to comply with Program requirements after a permitted restart. In such cases, the Participant may continue to use the training and dietary plan independently without further obligations from Atlas. Atlas Professionals may require performance or weight assessments during the Guarantee Phase, which must occur within fifteen (15) calendar days of request. Assessments may be in-person or virtual, at the Atlas Professional’s discretion, and will test both weight and at least one (1) strength or performance benchmark. The Program applies only to in-person training. Clients engaged exclusively in virtual or remote training are not eligible.
            Program benefits have no cash value, are non-transferable, and may not be redeemed for refunds or credits of any kind. The remedies provided under the Program constitute the Participant’s sole and exclusive relief, and Atlas disclaims all other remedies, warranties, or guarantees, express or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
            Atlas reserves the right to request, audit, and validate any Adherence Records, medical documents, or Atlas Professional attestations. Participants consent to Atlas’s collection and processing of health-related information for Program administration in accordance with Atlas’s Privacy Policy. Misrepresentation, falsification, or material omission by either Participant or Atlas Professional results in immediate forfeiture of Program benefits and may result in account suspension under these Terms. The remedies described herein constitute the Participant’s sole and exclusive relief under the Program.

            ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
            PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
            You and Atlas agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
            This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between you and Atlas, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Atlas, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.
            By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Atlas as follows:
            Initial Dispute Resolution: Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach Atlas support department at. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the Atlas support department, and good faith negotiations will be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
            Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or previous versions of these Terms (including the Terms' or Privacy Policy's formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Platform will be finally settled by binding arbitration, as described below.
            Where the relief sought by you is $10,000.99 or less and you do not wish to bring the claim in small claims court, the arbitration will be conducted online by an online arbitration provider of our choosing in accordance with their applicable arbitration rules & procedures effective at the time a claim is made. Currently, you may initiate arbitration proceedings on the FairClaims.com. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.
            Where the relief sought is $10,001.00 or more, resolution will be in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000.00 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000.00 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. To initiate an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 7160 Rafael Rivera Way, Suite 400, Las Vegas, NV 89113. You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous.You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.                                                                                  
            The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award will be written and will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
            If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration will be initiated in the state of California, United States. You and Atlas further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            Class Action Waiver The parties further agree that the arbitration will be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND ATLAS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above will be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties will be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
            Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect your or our intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, trade dress, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
            30-Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address you use on Atlas) written notice of your decision. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the later of the Effective Date of these Terms or your first use of the Platform; otherwise, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Atlas also will not be bound by them.
            Changes to This Section: Atlas will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes affecting the substance of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section by posting on the Atlas Terms of Use website, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Atlas Terms of Use website or sent to you.
            Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the 30th day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection will be severed from the section entitled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator will apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Platform.
            Survival: This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section will survive any termination of your Account or the Platform.
            Third-Party Beneficiary: You and Atlas acknowledge that any third-party consumer reporting agency that Atlas uses to perform background checks on Atlas Professionals is an express and intended third-party beneficiary of this arbitration provision and as such, the terms of this Arbitration provision will inure to the benefit of the consumer reporting agencies and may be enforced by them. Accordingly, you agree that any dispute that arises between you and a consumer reporting agency that relates to or arises out of this Agreement or any aspect of your relationship with Atlas will be resolved by binding arbitration. If any court or arbitrator determines that this third-party beneficiary subsection is void or unenforceable for any reason, then this subsection will be severed from the section entitled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the remainder of the section will remain enforceable, meaning that the class action waiver and the mutual obligation to resolve disputes between you and Atlas through binding arbitration remains enforceable.

            A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.
            If you are not a California resident, you waive your rights under any statute or common law principle similar to Section 1542 that governs your rights in the jurisdiction of your residence.
            GENERAL
            Force Majeure: Other than payment obligations, neither Atlas nor you will be liable to the other for any delay or failure in performance under the Terms arising out of a cause beyond your or our control and without your or our fault or negligence. Such causes may include but are not limited to fires, floods, earthquakes, strikes, unavailability of necessary utilities, blackouts, epidemics, acts of declared or undeclared war, acts of regulatory agencies, or other disasters.
            No Third-Party Beneficiaries: You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there will be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.
            Contacting You and E-SIGN Consent: You agree that Atlas may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Platform. With your consent, Atlas, Consumers, Atlas Professionals, or other individuals may also contact you by telephone or through text messages. If you have agreed to receive text messages or telephone calls from Atlas, Consumers, Atlas Professionals, or other individuals you also consent to the use of an electronic record to document your agreement. You may withdraw your consent to the use of the electronic record by contacting Atlas with "Revoke Electronic Consent" in the subject line. To view and retain a copy of this disclosure or any information regarding your enrollment in this program, you will need (a) a device (such as a computer or mobile phone) with a web browser and Internet access; and (b) either a printer or storage space on such device. 
            Entire Agreement: These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or additional terms and conditions or policies published by Atlas on the Platform, will constitute the entire agreement between you and Atlas concerning the Platform or Pro Services obtained through the Platform. Except as explicitly stated herein, if any provision of the Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.
            Waiver: No waiver of any provision of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Atlas's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            Statute of Limitations: You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim arising out of or related to the Platform or the Pro Services offered therein must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this statute of limitations will not apply to residents of New Jersey.
            Section Headings: The section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
